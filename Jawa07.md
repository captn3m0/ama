# Questions with Shobhita Agarwal @Jawa07 (Ex-Founder of Sair)

<details>

<summary>What is the revenue model like? How do you project your growth in upcoming years</summary>

The revenue model is percentage per booking (typically 13-17%). Over the next year, we were also going to provide chargeable SAAS platforms for travel agents and travel influencers, like a 3 way collaborative product offering logistics, experience creation and customer acquisition.

<summary>What made you to leave your job and startup? Which part of it you think you should solve the problem</summary>

Had been planning to startup for a while, had done some part time gigs earlier. In March 2019, I made a goal that I want to finally do a full time startup before end of 2019. So, I started meeting people, met a lot of them, hackled many brains, pestered many people including Nilesh Trivedi. Somewhere in July, I was introduced to my cofounder through common social circles, we had similar interests and motivation to invest our effort and time for the next 5-6 years into it. So, we got together, chalked the plan out, hired people and launched the MVP in November.

I left my job with calculated risks:

- was financially comfortable to skip salary for a while
- was extremely motivated at that point of time(this is very imp - motivation comes in spurts and you need to catch it when it comes by)
- had the right set of network with people who had done successful startups so we could easily leverage the available help
- had investor interest (from VC and colleagues and friends)
- was confident of landing a job if it didn't work out.

> What part of it (the motivation) made you think that you’d be the right person to solve the problem (that your startup is addressing). AKA, why that specific problem.

We started up thinking about a particular problem and a larger domain space for market size. We calculated that travel is a 100B\$ (dont recall the exact number) market space. In order to build a long term business, the market size and the domain made sense and excited me. Plus, I wanted to build something in the B2C space so that aligned as well

<summary>How was your startup different than the current existing ones? I mean there are so many, even around providing customized experience. And how did you plan to expand it further, had you continued with it? Also, it'd be helpful if you can share how those ideas can look like in a post-corona world</summary>

We were building a white labelled travel experience platform similar to `klook.com` leveraging the travel influencer network for creativity and meesho model for customer acquisition. There is no big enough platform where I can go and book travel experiences, I have heavily used `getyourguide.com` when I travelled to Europe and `klook.com` when I travelled to Thailand. We do not have a large scale trusted brand like that for Indian experiences. A foreign traveller coming in India is dependent on less informed travel agents or their hotel desk or tripadvisor. Tripadvisor is an affliate platform, it does not guarantee QOS (Quality of Service), its analogous to how a marketplace is different from a shop. We were building a branded shop.

The other differences lied in the approach and metrics. One of the challenges in travel is high CAC (Cost of Customer Acquisition), typically 2-3K INR. We were trying to reduce it through different ways of customer acquisition - meesho model was working very well for us. We had some more experimental models WIP.
The long term plan was to create a 3 way ecosystem to enable all stakeholders to make money in it.

1. Creators (travel influencers, part time enthusiasts, guides, hikers etc)
2. Logistics (travel agents, transportation, hotels etc)
3. Sellers (neighbourhood people, friends, colleagues who will get us customers for a small cut)

**Post corona world**:
The same plan/idea will work in a long term timeline (>2 years)
In shorter timeline, staycations and less frequented destinations will work. Group activities, shared economy will not work. Our idea was more around collaborative ecosystem so it will be difficult to get a lot of revenue with it in the shorter timeline.

<summary>How did law process look like? Did you have to register a company? What kind of? Is it hard to close it? Any gotchas for people from tech background who are completely unaware in Indian law context around startup</summary>

Yes, we registered a company under travel category. It was a quick process, we hired a consultant to help us.

For people from tech background - If you do not understand finances and do not know how to interpret multiple page documents and agreements, hire a credible consultant (preferably someone who has worked with startups before) because you will be signing a lot of documents and you do not want to sign anything unknowingly.

<summary>Do you have product market fit yet? What does your MRR look like? How many employees do you have? What made you work on it in the first place? Was it the personal itch you were trying to solve? I rezlied it says ex, why did you decided to leave? and what are you doing currently? There’s a lot of competition in this space, what made you still persevere? What is something about this space that other people just don’t get it? How many experiences you have booked so far? What made you work on it in the first place</summary>

I answered this in detail in one of the above questions but in short, I was excited by the B2C space and travel domain (I love travelling).

> why did you decided to leave ?

Somewhere in March when we started getting booking cancellations due to Covid, we initially thought it was a temporary problem and had drafted some plans for company survival (focus on product stability) but soon we realised that covid wasn't going anywhere soon. We had funds to last for a few months but it wasn't long enough to get past covid. So for survival, we decided to pivot. When we started discussing on new ideas, we naturally gravitated towards social commerce since we already had meesho model going on for travel.
I took a step back and rethought what I wanted to do in the long term. I left because
If I have to restart from scratch, I do not want to do a ops heavy business. I want to build a SAAS product instead.
My cofounder and I had very different working style and we weren't completely compatible which I realised after working together for a while.

> what are you doing currently?

- Exploring opportunities in IC role
- Reflecting on the roller coaster ride I had in the last few months
- Reprioritising stuff in life

> There’s a lot of competition in this space, what made you still persevere?

Have answered about the idea in detail in one of the questions above

> What is something about this space that other people just don’t get it

Many people don't get that: Quality of travel experiences can be quantified

> How many experiences you have booked so far?

roughly about 150

> Do you still have the stocks of ex company with you?

when VC invests in your company, they typically add a one year cliff clause. so, no

<summary>What were some of the most difficult things you faced while running it? How did you hire people? What did you look in a person while hiring? Looking back, what are a few things you'd do differently</summary>

**Most difficult things**:

- Hiring talented people, especially devs (the conversion ratio is 2/100)
- Building a team from nothing, making people believe in the idea and the vision, making people believe that this is the next big thing and that they should be a part of it.
- stablishing the right culture, keeping the team motivation up even when things look bleak, when all experiments fail, when nothing seems to work out. You have to keep believing in it even though you know its failing. If you don't do this, you can't keep your team together.
- Balancing between people getting burnt out and blazing fast deliveries and rollouts
- Investor relations, public relations, story telling - This is something I had never done, but had to do, was never good at it or liked it, but had to do it anyway
- My toughest personal fight was to go from being an isolated IC (who would just sit in a corner with her headphones blazing loud music and code) to a Managerial role (which involved heavy interaction, story telling, alignment, team motivation, cross functional role. I was doing everything under the hood - Being a developer + manager + product guy + marketing guy + HR + Admin + Finances + ground operations. It was exhausting.

> How did you hire people? What did you look in a person while hiring?

**Tech hiring was** -

- Role specific skillset check
- Problem solving
- System designing
- One interview with my senior product manager
- Culture fit/Motivation check round with my cofounder

**Marketing/operations hiring** -

- Testing their past experience in handling B2C operations
- Working with tools
- Managing teams
- Knowledge of models and metrics
- Culture fit round

> Looking back, what are a few things you'd do differently?

Do more research on the idea. Some of the assumptions we had made while starting up got broken soon after we started rolling out. Many metrics we had put on our deck started looking unreasonable soon enough. I will spend more effort and time in better planning and heavy research when I start up again next time. I guess my motivation had overshadowed the rationale.
Spend enough time while evaluating a cofounder/partner. I was told by many people that its better to start with a friend or an ex colleague but I didn't realize the importance of that back then. A startup is very demanding of your time, effort, mindset. It bends you out of shape. At a time like this, if you work with someone who you already know, its easier to accept their mistakes, their shortcomings (everyone has them). With an unknown person, its left to chance and luck.

- Will start small, spend more effort in consolidation before expansion.
- Will not do a operations heavy business

> I too feel hardest part is hiring the right people. Wish you luck in your future endeavours

<summary>Not a trolling question, but a genuine one: Because I'm an avid instagram user, I keep seeing bloggers/influencers calling out brands for exploiting them and brands calling out influencers for throwing tantrums. If you have any incident to share/opinions/point of view/comment around this topic, it'd be great. In case you don't wanna name the influencers, it's completely fine</summary>

I dont have any example of that nature. Many influencers typically work through agencies and all those hassles get encapsulated at the agency level.
